# Setup

Begin by loading test data and the required packages below: 

```{r message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(datateachr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(testthat))
```

# Exercise 1 & 2: Make and Document a Function

In the data analysis of STAT 545A, I repeated the code to calculate the summary statistics and create boxplot across different groups for comparison. Therefore, I would like to make a function called `summary_and_boxplot_by_group()` to do the job for me.

# Exercise 3: Examples

# Exercise 4: Test the Function
